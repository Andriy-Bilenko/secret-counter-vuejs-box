# Secret Counter Box

Successfully went through the course. Deployed "counter" smart contract locally in the docker container as well as on the testnet. Additionally built "counter" dApp and deployed on ipfs (https://bafybeig5xhhi2tlemnthuv4ldooo2c5axy34gjntm6eft5cvswpsdbgngm.ipfs.flk-ipfs.xyz/) (please do not abuse it, it is hardcoded to use my testnet wallet for fees)

Even though everything is dirty and for learning purposes only, you can still view all actions I did in `note#1.md` and `note2#.md`.
